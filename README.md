# Learning Notes

Personal place where I put some code while learning languages or something

## "Roadmap"

### Done

  - **Lua**: a great language that's easy to learn and the C API is FUN AF

## In process

  - **Dart**: pretty cool tbh, very flexible and minimalistic by design imo
  - **D**: weird af imo, but i'm still a bit interested

## Pending

  - **Nim**: DAMN, I LOVE THIS SHIT, still i think i need to learn about pragmas, macros and some language details, but at this point i think i can write Nim code
  - **C**: pointers, unions, bit fields, standard library and... uh, idk
  - **Vala**: i feel i can write Vala code, but i still don't known so much about vala, btw, vala is cool honestly
  - **C++**: ok this one is really optional for me, since i think is weird and i feel lazy about it
  - **Zig**: _i  n  t  e  r  e  s  t  i  n  g_
  - **Swift**: _i  n  t  e  r  e  s  t  i  n  g     2_

## "Not listed"

Ok, there are some languages I have tried before and my opinion

  - **Python**: my brother in christ, please fix your performance... still cool ngl
  - **Ruby**: my beloved, anybody understand you, but i really think you're fun af but also weird af, i love it
  - **C#**: **i hope some day u will disappear from existence**
  - **Java**: **i hope some day u will disappear from existence**
  - **Go**: i can't hate u, but also can't love u... still good ngl, but not for me
  - **Genie**: ok hear me out, there's this really insteresting language, but sadly anyone don't even know what the hell is Vala...
  - **PHP**: **OH GOD LORD, PLEASE DELETE THIS GARBAGE FROM EXISTENCE**
