# Learning Notes

Personal place where I put some code while learning languages or something

## "Roadmap"

### Done

  - **Lua**: a great language that's easy to learn and the C API is FUN AF

## In process

  - **Dart**: pretty cool tbh, very flexible and minimalistic by design imo
  - **D**: weird af imo, but i'm still a bit interested

## Pending

  - **Nim**: DAMN, I LOVE THIS SHIT, still i think i need to learn about pragmas, macros and some language details, but at this point i think i can write Nim code
  - **C**: pointers, unions, bit fields, standard library and... uh, idk
  - **Vala**: i feel i can write Vala code, but i still don't known so much about vala, btw, vala is cool honestly
  - **C++**: ok this one is really optional for me, since i think is weird and i feel lazy about it
  - **Zig**: _i  n  t  e  r  e  s  t  i  n  g_
  - **Swift**: _i  n  t  e  r  e  s  t  i  n  g     2_
